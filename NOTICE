Scintillua is built-in to the 3.x series of Scintilla as of version 3.8.0.
As a result, this project is deprecated and will no longer be updated. Please
note that Scintillua is not built-in to Scintilla 4.x and likely never will be,
due to compiler constraints. (I am limited to a C++11 compiler, while Scintilla
4.x requires a C++17 compiler.)
